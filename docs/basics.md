# Django basics

Django is a framework to develop websites. _It is not a server!_

## Details

Django follows the Model View Template (MVT):

- _Model_: handles all the data interactions (database).
- _View_: its the intermediate element between the client and the host. It
  receives a HTTP request and decides what to do based on that request. In
  simple terms, the view is a function (could be a class too) that receives
  a HTTP request and must return a HTTP response.
- _Template_: where you store and renderize all your html files.

We do not work directly in the `project/` directory. Django uses apps to separate
the whole application in little pieces to better organize and manage all the
components. The organization and separation of a piece of the application
into apps is totally developer charged, you decide how the apps will look like
and how they will be separated.
